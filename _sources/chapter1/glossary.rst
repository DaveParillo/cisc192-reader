Glossary
--------

problem-solving:
    The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and
    expressing the solution.

high-level language:
    A programming language like C++ that is designed to be easy for
    humans to read and write.

low-level language:
    A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to
    execute. Also called “machine language” or “assembly language.”

portability:
    A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of
    computer.

formal language:
    Any of the languages people have designed for specific purposes,
    like representing mathematical ideas or computer programs. All
    programming languages are formal languages.

natural language:
    Any of the languages people speak that have evolved naturally.

interpret:
    To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one
    line at a time.

compile:
    To translate a program in a high-level language into a low-level
    language, all at once, in preparation for later execution.

source code:
    A program in a high-level language, before being compiled.

object code:
    The output of the compiler, after translating the program.

executable:
    Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

algorithm:
    A general process for solving a category of problems.

bug:
    An error in a program.

syntax:
    The structure of a program.

semantics:
    The meaning of a program.

parse:
    To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

syntax error:
    An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and
    therefore impossible to compile).

run-time error:
    An error in a program that makes it fail at run-time.

logical error:
    An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the
    programmer intended.

debugging:
    The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of errors.
