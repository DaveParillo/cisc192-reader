More generalization
-------------------

As another example of generalization, imagine you wanted a program that
would print a multiplication table of any size, not just the 6x6 table.
You could add a parameter to ``multiples_table``:

::

   void multiples_table (int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       print_multiples (i);
       i = i + 1;
     }
   }

I replaced the value 6 with the parameter ``high``. If I call
``multiples_table`` with the argument 7, I get

::

   1   2   3   4   5   6
   2   4   6   8   10   12
   3   6   9   12   15   18
   4   8   12   16   20   24
   5   10   15   20   25   30
   6   12   18   24   30   36
   7   14   21   28   35   42

which is fine, except that I probably want the table to be square (same
number of rows and columns), which means I have to add another parameter
to ``print_multiples``, to specify how many columns the table should
have.

Just to be annoying, I will also call this parameter ``high``,
demonstrating that different functions can have parameters with the same
name (just like local variables):

::

   void print_multiples (int n, int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       cout << n*i << "   ";
       i = i + 1;
     }
     cout << endl;
   }

   void multiples_table (int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       print_multiples (i, high);
       i = i + 1;
     }
   }

Notice that when I added a new parameter, I had to change the first line
of the function (the interface or prototype), and I also had to change
the place where the function is called in ``multiples_table``. As
expected, this program generates a square 7x7 table:

::

   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   2   4   6   8   10   12   14
   3   6   9   12   15   18   21
   4   8   12   16   20   24   28
   5   10   15   20   25   30   35
   6   12   18   24   30   36   42
   7   14   21   28   35   42   49

   :language: cpp

   The active code below uses the updated ``multiples_table`` function.
   Notice that with generalization, we can create multiplication tables of
   multiple sizes by simply changing the parameter passed into ``multiples_table``.
   Run the active code to see what happens!
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   using std::cout;

   void print_multiples (int n, int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       cout << n*i << '\t';
       i = i + 1;
     }
     cout << '\n';
   }

   void multiples_table (int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       print_multiples (i, high);
       i = i + 1;
     }
   }

   int main() {
     multiples_table(7);
   }

When you generalize a function appropriately, you often find that the
resulting program has capabilities you did not intend. For example, you
might notice that the multiplication table is symmetric, because
:math:`ab = ba`, so all the entries in the table appear twice. You could
save ink by printing only half the table. To do that, you only have to
change one line of ``multiples_table``. Change

::

         print_multiples (i, high);

to

::

         print_multiples (i, i);

and you get

::

   1
   2   4
   3   6   9
   4   8   12   16
   5   10   15   20   25
   6   12   18   24   30   36
   7   14   21   28   35   42   49

Iâ€™ll leave it up to you to figure out how it works.

.. activecode:: more_generalization_AC_2
   :language: cpp
   :caption: Two-dimensional tables

   Modify the previous program so that it only prints
   half the multiplication table.

   Run the active code to see how you did!
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   using std::cout;

   void print_multiples (int n, int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       cout << n*i << '\t';
       i = i + 1;
     }
     cout << '\n';
   }

   void multiples_table (int high) {
     int i = 1;
     while (i <= high) {
       print_multiples (i, high);
       i = i + 1;
     }
   }

   int main() {
     multiples_table(7);
   }
