--------

modulus:
    An operator that works on integers and yields the remainder when one
    number is divided by another. In C++ it is denoted with a percent
    sign (%).

conditional:
    A block of statements that may or may not be executed depending on
    some condition.

chaining:
    A way of joining several conditional statements in sequence.

nesting:
    Putting a conditional statement inside one or both branches of
    another conditional statement.

recursion:
    The process of calling the same function you are currently
    executing.

infinite recursion:
    A function that calls itself recursively without every reaching the
    base case. Eventually an infinite recursion will cause a run-time
    error.
