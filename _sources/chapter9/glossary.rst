Glossary
--------

instance:
   An example from a category. My cat is an instance of the category
   "feline things." Every object is an instance of some type.

instance variable:
   One of the named data items that make up an structure. Each structure
   has its own copy of the instance variables for its type.

constant reference parameter:
   A parameter that is passed by reference but that cannot be modified.

pure function:
   A function whose result depends only on its parameters, and that has
   so effects other than returning a value.

functional programming style:
   A style of program design in which the majority of functions are
   pure.

modifier:
   A function that changes one or more of the objects it receives as
   parameters, and usually returns ``void``.

fill-in function:
   A function that takes an "empty" object as a parameter and fills it
   its instance variables instead of generating a return value.

algorithm:
   A set of instructions for solving a class of problems by a
   mechanical, unintelligent process.
