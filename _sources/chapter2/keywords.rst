Keywords
--------

.. index::
   single: keyword

A few sections ago, I said that you can make up any name you want for
your variables, but thatâ€™s not quite true. There are certain words that
are reserved in C++ because they are used by the compiler to parse the
structure of your program, and if you use them as variable names, it
will get confused. These words, called **keywords**, include 
:cpp:`int <keyword/int>`, :cpp:`char <keyword/char>`,
:lang:`return`, :cpp:`using <keyword/using>` and many more.

C++ :cpp:`keywords <keyword>` are available publicly on ``cppreference``.
Many of the C++ language links from this textbook link to this site,
for example:

    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword

Rather than memorize the list, I would suggest that you take advantage
of a feature provided in many development environments: source code
highlighting. As you type, different parts of your program should appear
in different colors. For example, keywords might be blue, strings red,
and other code black. 

.. caution::
   If you type a variable name and it turns the color of a keyword in your editor, 
   then watch out! You might get 
   some strange behavior from the compiler.
 
In addition to keywords, the facilities you include in your programs
using ``#include`` add additional names that you want to avoid
conflict with. The include files 
:io:`iostream <basic_iostream>`, :cpp:`string`, and :container:`vector`
are commonly included.

.. note::
   Case matters!  You can name a ``string`` variable ``String`` without an issue
   because C++ does not consider ``String`` to be the same as ``string``.
   Also, a anything written in quotes, for example ``"string"`` is not considered
   a keyword or variable in C++, even if it is spelled the same.

Unlike variables and standard library objects like ``cout``,
you can't put a variable or object in a namespace to avoid a name conflict
with a language keyword.
The language keywords are always "in scope".
More on scope and namespaces in the next chapter.

      .. fillintheblank:: keywords_1

         Words that are reserved in C++ because they are used by the compiler to parse the structure of your program are called |blank|.

         :answer_a: integer

         :answer_d: string
         :answer_e: char
         :correct: b,d,e
         :feedback_a: integer is not a keyword, but int is.
         :feedback_b: cout should not be used as a variable name.
         :feedback_c: variable is fair game to use to name a variable.
         :feedback_d: string should not be used as a variable name.
         :feedback_e: char is a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name.

         Multiple Response: Which of the following are keywords or will otherwise generate some error from the compiler if used as a variable name?
