Keywords
--------

.. index::
   single: keyword

A few sections ago, I said that you can make up any name you want for
your variables, but thatâ€™s not quite true. There are certain words that
are reserved in C++ because they are used by the compiler to parse the
structure of your program, and if you use them as variable names, it
will get confused. These words, called **keywords**, include ``int``, ``char``,
``void``, ``endl`` and many more.

A list of C++ keywords is available publicly on ``cppreference``.  You can
take a look for yourself by pasting the following link into your browser.

Rather than memorize the list, I would suggest that you take advantage
of a feature provided in many development environments: code
highlighting. As you type, different parts of your program should appear
in different colors. For example, keywords might be blue, strings red,
and other code black. 

.. caution::
   If you type a variable name and it turns the color of a keyword in your editor, 
   then watch out! You might get 
   some strange behavior from the compiler.

.. note::
   Case matters!  You can name a ``string`` variable ``String`` without an issue
   because C++ does not consider ``String`` to be the same as keyword ``string``.
   Also, a anything written in quotes, for example ``"string"`` is not considered
   a keyword in C++, even if it is spelt the same.

Unlike variables and standard library objects like ``cout``,
you can't put a variable or object in a namespace to avoid a name conflict.
The language keywords are always "in scope".
More on scope and namespaces in the next chapter.

         Words that are reserved in C++ because they are used by the compiler to parse the structure of your program are called |blank|.

         :feedback_a: integer is not a keyword, but int is.
         :feedback_b: cout cannot be used as a variable name!
         :feedback_c: variable is fair game to use to name a variable.
         :feedback_d: string cannot be used as a variable name.
         :feedback_e: char is a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name.

         Multiple Response: Which of the following are keywords or will otherwise generate some error from the compiler if used as a variable name?

         Fix the code below so that it runs without errors.  Hint: you might need to change the names of some variables.

         int main () {
