Order of Operations
-------------------

.. index::
   single: precedence
   single: order of operations

When more than one operator appears in an expression the order of
evaluation depends on the rules of **precedence**. A complete
explanation of precedence can get complicated, but just to get you
started:

-  Multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
   So ``2 * 3 - 1`` yields 5, not 4, and ``2 / 3 - 1`` yields -1, not 1 
   (remember that in integer division ``2/3`` is 0).

-  If the operators have the same precedence they are evaluated from
   left to right. So in the expression ``minute * 100 / 60``, the multiplication
   happens first, yielding ``5900 / 60``, which in turn yields 98. If the
   operations had gone from right to left, the result would be 59 * 1
   which is 59, which is wrong.

-  Any time you want to override the rules of precedence (or you are not
   sure what they are) you can use parentheses. Expressions in parentheses 
   are evaluated first, so ``2 * (3 - 1) is 4``. You can also use parentheses 
   to make an expression easier to read, as in ``(minute * 100) / 60``, even 
   though it doesnâ€™t change the result.

   Observe the output of the code below to see how the placement of parentheses can change the result of a calculation.

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main () {
       cout << (2 * 3) - 1 << endl;
       cout << 2 * (3 - 1) << endl;
       cout << 2 / 3 - 1 << endl;
       cout << 2 / (3 -1) << endl;
   }

         Match the expression to its correct output. Don't forget to consider integer 
         division!

         ::

             1 + 5

         is the only operation remaining.  I'm not going to ask you any questions
         about it.  However, it's important that you can wrap you head around the fact that
         the ``+`` operator appeared **first** in the calculation, but it was the **last**
         operator to be evaluated.  The order of operations can be kind of confusing
         at times, but I think you've got a good grasp of the concept!
