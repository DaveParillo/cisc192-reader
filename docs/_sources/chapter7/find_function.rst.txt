The ``find`` function
---------------------

The ``string`` class provides several other functions that you can
invoke on strings. 
The ``find`` function is like the opposite of the ``[]`` operator.
Instead of taking an index and extracting the character at that index, 
``find`` takes a character and finds the index where that character appears.


.. activecode:: find_function_AC_1
   :language: cpp
   :compileargs: ['-Wall', '-std=c++11']
   :nocodelens:
   :caption: The find function

   Take a look at the active code below, which uses the ``find`` function to find
   the character ``'a'`` in string ``fruit`` and string ``dessert``.
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>
 
   int main() {
       std::string fruit = "banana";
       int index = fruit.find('a');
       std::cout << index << '\n';
       std::string dessert = "pudding";
       int another_index = fruit.find('a');
       std::cout << another_index << '\n';
   }

This example finds the index of the letter ``'a'`` in the string. In
this case, the letter appears three times, so it is not obvious what
``find`` should do. 
According to the documentation, 
it returns the index of the *first* appearance, 
so the result is 1. If the given letter does not appear in the string, 
``find`` returns the special value ``std::string::npos``,
which is a number larger than any valid position in a string.

In addition, there is a version of ``find`` that takes another
``string`` as an argument and that finds the index where the substring
appears in the string. 

.. activecode:: find_function_AC_2
   :language: cpp
   :compileargs: ['-Wall', '-std=c++11']
   :nocodelens:
   :caption: The find function

   The active code below finds the starting index of ``"nan"`` in ``fruit``.
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>
 
   int main() {
       std::string fruit = "banana";
       int index = fruit.find("nan");
       std::cout << index;
   }

This example returns the value 2.

You should remember from SectionÂ `[overloading] <#overloading>`__ that
there can be more than one function with the same name, as long as they
take a different number of parameters or different types. In this case,
C++ knows which version of ``find`` to invoke by looking at the type of
the argument we provide.

         What is printed when the code is run?
