The Return Statement
--------------------

.. index::
   single: return statement

The ``return`` statement allows you to terminate the execution of a function
before you reach the end. One reason to use it is if you detect an error
condition:

.. activecode:: return_AC_1
   :language: cpp
   :caption: Terminating a Function with a Return

   This program will terminate with a return statement if the argument
   provided is not positive.  Try running the code as is.  If you get
   an error message, try changing the value of x.
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cmath>

   void print_logarithm (double x) {
       if (x <= 0.0) {
           std::cout << "Positive numbers only, please.\n";
           return;
       }
       double result = log (x);
       std::cout << "The log of " << x << " is " << result;
   }

    int main() {
        double y = -9.8;
        print_logarithm(y);
        return 0;
    }

This defines a function named ``print_logarithm`` that takes a ``double`` 
named ``x`` as a parameter.
The first thing it does is check whether x is less than
or equal to zero, in which case it displays an error message and then
uses ``return`` to exit the function. The flow of execution immediately
returns to the caller and the remaining lines of the function are not
executed.

I used a floating-point value on the right side of the condition because
there is a floating-point variable on the left.

Remember that any time you want to use one a function from the math
library, you have to include the header file ``<cmath>``.

Putting ``return 0;`` in your code ends your program.
Let's look back at a program from section 4.3.

         :feedback_d: 8 is not greater than 8, so the first condition will not be met.

         :feedback_a: Take a look at the first conditional statement more closely.
         :feedback_b: 8 is not greater than 8, so it doesn't meet the first condition.
         :feedback_c: All of the following are "if" statements, with no return. There are no "else" statements.
