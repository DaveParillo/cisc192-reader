.. tabbed:: tab_check

   .. tab:: Q1

      .. mchoice:: programming_1

          What is a **program** in computer science?

          -   a planned series of events, a schedule

              -   This is a definition of a program, just not in the computer science sense.

          -   a translated language that is easy for the computer to understand

              -   This is actually called a low-level language!

          -   a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation

              +   You can write these instructions to accomplish pretty much anything 
                  you want!

          -   a general process for solving a category of problems

              -   This is actually called an algorithm!


   .. tab:: Q2

      .. mchoice:: programming_2

          What is the function of the compiler?

          -   It loads the program from its saved location and makes the computer execute it.

              -   This is the function of an executor.  If you use a compiler, you must also
                  use an executer to run your code.

          -   It reads a high-level program and translates everything at once, before executing
              any of the commands.

              +   If there are any errors in your code, the program will not compile.  It is an
                  all-or-nothing process.

          -   It translates the program from the low-level language you coded in to a high-level
              language that the computer can understand.

              -   You, the programmer, write your program in a HIGH-level language.  It is then
                  translated to a LOW-level language that the computer can understand.

          -   It translates the program line-by-line, alternately reading lines and carrying 
              out commands.

              -   This is the function of an interpreter.


   .. tab:: Q3

      .. mchoice:: programming_3

          What is the difference between **source code** and **object code**?

          -   Source code can contain simple things like variables and values.  Object code 
              can contain more complex objects like data structures.

              -   Contrary to it's name, object code has nothing to do with creating objects!

          -   Object code can contain simple things like variables and values.  Source code 
              can contain more complex objects like data structures.

              -   Source code and object code both contain variables, values, and data structures.
                  They're just written in a different way.

          -   Object code is the code that your program is written in.  Source code is the
              translated version of this code that the computer can understand.

              -   You seem to have things a bit mixed up!

          -   Source code is the code that your program is written in.  Object code is the
              translated version of this code that the computer can understand.

              +   The computer can either use an interpreter or a compiler to make the 
                  translation.


   .. tab:: Q4

      .. mchoice:: programming_4

          **Multiple Response**  What are the basic functions that appear in
          every programming language?

          -   math operations

              +   This is how your program can carry out complex calculations!

          -   debugging

              -   Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors AFTER you 
                  have written your program. It's not one of the basic functions
                  of a programming language.

          -   input/output from the terminal and saved files

              +   This allows your program to communicate with data either from the user, 
                  or from the user's saved files.

          -   testing for conditions

              +   This is why you would consider using conditional statements
                  in your program.

          -   repetition

              +   This is why you would consider using a loop in your program.


   .. tab:: Q5

      .. mchoice:: programming_5

          What type of error would the following code cause?  Assume you are
          trying to calculate the volume of a cylinder:

          ::

              int radius = 7;
              int height = 8;
              double volume = 3.14 * radius * height;

          -   syntax error

              -   There is nothing wrong with the structure of this program.

          -   run-time error

              -   There are no errors that will surface at runtime.

          -   semantic error

              +   This is not the correct formula for calculating the volume of a
                  cylinder.  This program will go on to calculate the wrong volume
                  because it doesn't know any better.

          -   no error

              -   Take a look at the area formula.


   .. tab:: Q6

      .. mchoice:: programming_6

          What type of error would the following generate?  Assume you are
          trying to calculate the volume of a cylinder:

          ::

              int radius = 7;
              int height = 8
              double volume = 3.14 * r * r * height;

          -   syntax error

              +   You are missing a semicolon on the second line, and you are using
                  the variable ``r`` without defining it on the third line.  your
                  program will not compile.

          -   run-time error

              -   There are no errors that will surface at runtime.

          -   semantic error

              -   Everything looks good with your volume calculations.

          -   no error

              -   Take a closer look at the structure of the code.


   .. tab:: Q7

      .. mchoice:: programming_7

          **Multiple Response**  C++ is a(n) ________.

          -   formal language

              +   all programming languages are formal languages!

          -   natural language

              -   C++ certainly did not evolve naturally!

          -   foreign language

              -   C++ might seem foreign to you, but it's used globally!

          -   high-level language.

              +   C++ must be translated before the computer can understand!

          -   low-level language.

              -   The computer doesn't understand C++ until it gets translated!


   .. tab:: Q8

      .. mchoice:: programming_8

          **Multiple Response** Which of the following is true about writing a program.

          -   The compiler ignores anything after ``//``.

              +   This is called a comment, which you can use to describe your code to
                  outsiders who might not understand.

          -   There is no limit the number of statements you can put in ``main``.

              +   You can include as many statements as you want to, but it is good 
                  practice to keep the ``main`` as short as possible.

          -   Program execution begins at the first line of code.

              -   Program execution actually begins with ``main`` and then
                  happens in order, from top to bottom.

          -   ``main`` is enclosed by squiggly brackets ``{ }``.

              +   The ``main`` program and *all* functions in C++ are enclosed by squiggly brackets.

          -   The end of each statement is marked with a colon ``:``.

              -   Actually, each statement is terminated with a *semi* colon ``;``.


   .. tab:: Q9

      .. mchoice:: programming_9

          **Multiple Response** Which is true about programming languages?

          -   Low-level languages are only used for a few special applications.

              +   Low-level languages take more time to write, and they are much harder to
                  understand, so they aren't used often.

          -   Programs written in low-level languages must be translated before they can be run.

              -   Low level languages are already written in a language that your computer
                  can understand, so they don't need to be translated!

          -   It's easier to program in a high-level language than a low-level language.

              +   High-level languages take less time to write, they are much easier to
                  understand, and they are more likely to be correct!

          -   Computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages.

              +   This is why most programs need to be translated before they can be run!

          -   High-level languages can run on many different kinds of computers without an issue.

              +   This is called portability.


   .. tab:: Q10

      .. mchoice:: programming_10

          You were asked to parse through your program, what should this entail?

          -   You should walk through your program line by line to make sure it's 
              that your code doing what it is supposed to.

              -   This is how you would detect a semantic error. Parsing doesn't involve
                  semantic errors.

          -   You should search through your program for syntax errors.

              +   Parsing involves looking at the syntactic structure of your program.

          -   You should translate your program to object code.

              -   This would be quite a chore! Luckily you have an interpreter or a compiler
                  to do that for you!

          -   You should run your program and check for run-time errors.

              -   Parsing doesn't involve run-time errors.
