Glossary
--------

deterministic:
   A program that does the same thing every time it is run.

pseudorandom:
   A sequence of numbers that appear to be random, but which are
   actually the product of a deterministic computation.

seed:
   A value used to initialize a random number sequence. Using the same
   seed should yield the same sequence of values.

bottom-up design:
   A method of program development that starts by writing small, useful
   functions and then assembling them into larger solutions.

histogram:
   A vector of integers where each integer counts the number of values
   that fall into a certain range.
